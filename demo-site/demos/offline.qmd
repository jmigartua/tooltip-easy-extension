title: "Offline / no‑CDN"

By default, tooltip‑easy loads Tippy theme/animation CSS and Popper/Tippy UMD bundles from CDNs.  
For fully offline or CSP‑locked environments:

1. Download these assets and place them under your project (e.g., `assets/tooltip-easy/`):
   - `@popperjs/core@2` UMD
   - `tippy.umd.min.js`, `tippy.css`
   - `themes/light.css`, `themes/light-border.css`
   - `animations/scale-subtle.css`
   - (optional fallback) `mathjax@3` **tex-chtml** bundle

2. Edit `_extensions/tooltip-easy/shortcodes/tip.js` and replace the CDN URLs with your local paths.
3. Re-render; Quarto will bundle these static files with your site.
